The current process demands the project manager to manually update SharePoint, maintain the lookup table with application details after each new Splunk onboarding, and manually run Splunk chargeback reports monthly. This manual effort is time-consuming and hampers efficiency. Automating these tasks will not only save valuable time but also ensure accuracy in the onboarding process and chargeback reporting, allowing the project manager to focus on more strategic initiatives.


The successful implementation of automation using Python, PowerShell, and Jenkins marks a significant leap forward in efficiency. This automated process, seamlessly updating SharePoint, removing lookup table dependencies for chargeback, and generating chargeback reports, not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in reporting.

The automated validation and email notification system streamlines the communication process, empowering the project manager to effortlessly forward the finalized reports to the finance team. This achievement not only enhances operational efficiency but also allows the project manager to focus on higher-value tasks, driving overall productivity and effectiveness
